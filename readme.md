This is a Simulation to calculate the movement of relativistic electrons in a given magnetic array, constructed by singular dipoles. The trajectories are computed by Runge-Kutta 4th order and Euler Integration. These then are used to find emmitted Radiation.
The trajectories and frequencies can be used for tabletop Free-Electron-Lasers.
This Git also contains measaurements taken for the realization of the simulation, as well as the 3d-models we used to build it.

FEL_Simulationen.py contains the simulator. Examples for usage begin in line 260.
