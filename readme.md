This is a Simulation to calculate the movement of relativistic electrons in a given magnetic array, constructed by singular dipoles. The trajectories are computed by Runge-Kutta 4th order and Euler Integration. These then are used to find emmitted Radiation.

The trajectories and frequencies can be used for tabletop Free-Electron-Lasers.

### How to handle
FEL_Simulationen.py is the main code. Don't run it completely, doesnt work entirely and some cells take for ever. The given paths are my personal ones, probably throws errors there.

### TODOS
- find exact m according to measurements in tangential direction (magnet.opju
- look into 289-cell. something seems very wrong there.
